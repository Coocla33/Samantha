## Who *is* Samantha?
Samantha is a **Discord Bot**, she is designed to make the life in a server easier *(Making it more fun for users, making managing easier for server staff etc)*!

## What *can* Samantha do?
Samantha is designed to make the live in a server easier. At the moment Samantha can not do a lot, it has a good working **Bot Admin** system and that allows the server owner *(The creator of the server)* to assign the **Bot Admin** rights for certain user(s). There is also an **Achievement** system, this system encourages users to use the bot more to unlock secret achievements, that you wouldn't find otherwise, and more. There are a lot more things planned for **Samantha**!
